                <img src="images/tourimages/palancar.jpg" alt="picture of turtle">
                One of the best spots to dive is the Palancar Reef, 
                rising from depths of up to 80 meters to shallows 
                just beneath the surface of the sea at the southwest 
                end of the island. A popular dive includes a large bronze 
                figure of Christ placed some 17 meters underwater. 
                Other good diving locales are on the San Francisco, 
                Paraíso, Columbia, and Maracaibo reefs, 
                as well as the Santa Rosa Wall. And pretty much wherever 
                you dive, you're certain to see such exotic species as 
                angelfish, nurse sharks, sunfish, and sea turtles.

                <img src="images/tourimages/sanmiguel.jpg" alt="picture of turtle">
                On the northwest side of Cozumel, San Miguel de Cozumel is the island's 
                capital and offers many interesting distractions. In addition to being 
                a tourist hub, it's also a busy port. Many ferries depart regularly to 
                the mainland—particularly to Cancún and Playa del Carmen—and the port 
                also hosts cruise ships as they ply the sparkling waters of the 
                Caribbean Sea (be sure to check out the interesting Coral Reefs Monument 
                salocated near here). The town also boasts a major international airport.

                <img src="images/tourimages/laguna.jpg" alt="picture of turtle">
                One of the most interesting natural attractions on Cozumel is Laguna 
                Chankanaab, a small freshwater lake just seven kilometers south of 
                San Miguel de Cozumel in the National Marine Park. Cut off from the sea 
                (apart from a number of underground channels), it's a popular spot for 
                outings thanks to its crystal-clear water and numerous colorful tropical 
                fish, and is an enchanting place to swim, snorkel, and scuba dive.

                <img src="images/tourimages/sangervasio.jpg" alt="picture of turtle">
                More than 30 Mayan sites have been found on Cozumel, some of them in 
                beautiful locations such as dense jungle or perched above pristine 
                beaches. By far the most important is that of San Gervasio, built in AD 
                800 and located 16 kilometers from San Miguel de Cozumel. Highlights of 
                a visit include seeing the Temple of Ix-chel, for centuries the focal 
                point of the island's religious life and a place of pilgrimage from 
                across the Mayan empire.

                    5. Celarain: Cozumel's Lighthouse

                <img src="images/tourimages/celarain.jpg" alt="picture of turtle">
                The best known of Cozumel's lighthouses is Celarain (Faro de Celarain), 
                30 kilometers south of the capital of San Miguel. Built in 1901 and 
                recently fully restored with the addition of an interesting maritime 
                museum in the old lighthouse keeper's home, the lighthouse is perched at 
                the southernmost tip of the island in the nature reserve known as Parque 
                Punta Sur and is worth the visit and the climb of its 134 steps for its 
                wonderful views over the Caribbean Sea. It's a fun little excursion and 
                perfect for those looking for something that is typically not swamped 
                with the cruise crowds.

                A fun place to explore the diversity of Cozumel's coastline 
                and experience its flora and fauna, the Punta Sur Eco Beach 
                Park is the largest eco park on the island. Located at the 
                southern tip of the island, Punta Sur provides plenty of 
                great swimming and beach fun, as well as a chance to enjoy 
                some snorkeling, scuba diving, and kayaking. Part of the 
                240-plus-acre Parque Punta Sur, it's home to a diversity of 
                beaches, reefs, and lagoons, as well as a forested area 
                with plenty of walking trails.
